\section{Open-Source Contributions}

\cventry{Apache/Doris}
  {July 2022 - present}
  [An easy-to-use, high-performance and unified analytical database]
  [\iconlink[\faGithub][Apache/Doris]{https://github.com/apache/doris}]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  Add Tracing Mechanism for Doris
    \item  Implement some build-in functions
    \item  Improve the array datetime and decimal data types
    \item  Reform the metrics of Doris with bvar

\section{Project}

\cventry{MIT 6.824 Distributed Systems}
{Aug 2022 – Oct 2022}
[A distributed KV database developed based on Go]

\begin{itemize}
	\item Adopt Multi-Raft architecture, support data sharding processing and shard migration.
	\item Raft supports basic functions such as Leader election, log replication, and Snapshot.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{CMU 15445 Database Systems}
{Oct 2022 – Dec 2022}
[A stand-alone database that supports simple SQL operations based on C++]

\begin{itemize}
	\item The bottom layer designs BufferPool based on LRU, and all page operations are performed on BufferPool. At the same time, a scalable hash table is implemented in Buffer Pool.
	\item The statement execution adopts the volcano model and supports SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE, JOIN, AGGREGATION, LIMIT, and DISTINCT operations. Join has two implementations: Nested Loop Join and Hash Join.
	\item Concurrency control adopts 2PL design to realize three isolation levels of RU, RC, and RR.
\end{itemize}
